chrome-meta-debugger
====================

This Chrome extension was made to simplify the daily work with webpage meta data (head contents) like
titles, canonicals, Open Graph data, icons and many more things. 

It will add another panel to your Chrome DevTools and allow you to see all information at a glance, nicely grouped
and in real time.


How to install
--------------

- Open Google Chrome (if you are not already using it ;)
- Navigate to [Chrome Web Store / Extensions / Meta Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-debugger/jfpdemgdamgplelnlmaecbonkfgfgomp)
- Press "Install" / "Add"

A little icon should now appear right next to your address bar.\
If you now open the DevTools a new panel "Meta" should be provided.


How to use
----------

- Results are displayed in their source code order
- The result list is always kept up-to-date. When (for whatever reason) it seems stucked,\
  you may press the reload button located at the upper right.
- The filter can be easily used by starting typing (the input doesn't need to be focused before)
- You can filter by multiple arguments if you use `,` as delimiter (e.g. "title, canonical")
- To show up result options/actions simply hover its row


Future Plans
------------

- highlight real time changes within the list
- provide a history of all changes made after the initial page load to track JavaScript behaviors
